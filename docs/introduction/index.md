# Introduction

Artiﬁcial playing surfaces provide cost-effective, all-weather alter-natives to natural grass surfaces and are used for a wide range of sports and activities. Artificial turf has been in use for over 40 years. The initial premise was to use nylon and other synthetic materials to create a surface that was simple to maintain and could be used for indoor stadiums. History has shown us that this noble goal is quite a challenge and a frequent subject of controversy. In parts of the globe, there is an abundant number of synthetic ﬁelds currently in use for a variety of sports, including the NFL. Players at the high school, intercollegiate, and professional levels practice and compete on artiﬁcial playing surfaces with increasing frequency. Recent literature reviews have categorized the various types of artiﬁcial playing surfaces, investigated their biomechanical properties, and documented distinct injury patterns. The overall rate of football injuries has been reported to be signiﬁcantly higher on artiﬁcial surfaces compared with natural grass. It is increasingly clear that the playing surface is an important factor in injury incidences and mechanisms. 

John Powell from the University of Iowa was among the first to quantify the higher incidence of these injuries. He published a paper in 1992 which showed that professional football teams had more major knee injuries on artificial turf than compared on natural grass.
Since that time, artificial turf companies have made significant strides to simulate more natural surfaces. Despite these modern advancements, the effect of artificial turf on injury rates is still controversial. 
Natural grass fields are not free from problems either. There are studies that demonstrate that playing on a grass surface that is not well maintained may also increase injury rates.

This issue has become particularly important in cold-weather climate areas such as Green Bay, Minnesota, New England, and New York. In these areas the weather can take a heavy toll on the fields, making them dangerous, despite the best efforts of ground crews.
The question now becomes: Is today’s generation of synthetic surfaces responsible for an increased risk of sports injuries? The answer remains unclear, as not all research studies have arrived at the same conclusion.
Research does indicate a higher incidence rate of orthopedic injuries on artificial turf. For example, one study published in The American Journal of Sports Medicine concluded that college football players suffer about 1.39 times as many ACL tears when not playing on a natural surface.

Yet, according to other research, synthetic and natural surfaces lead to an equal number of orthopedic injuries.
A study of professional soccer players by the University of Rome found no difference in the injury rates of athletes playing on natural grass and those playing on artificial turf. Yet another study published by the U.S. National Library of Medicine reviewed injury rates from other research and determined that third-generation synthetic grss is comparable in safety to natural grass.
With the technological advent of the last few decades, it is possible to record a huge quantity of data from athletes. Wearable devices, video analysis systems, tracking systems, and questionnaires are only a few examples of the devices used currently to record data in sports. These data can be used for scouting, performance analysis, and tactical analysis, but an increased interest is in assessing the risk of injuries. With this huge amount of data, the use of complex models for data analysis is mandatory and, for this reason, machine learning models are increasingly used in sports science. In order to demonstrate the application of ML & showcase the outcome of the ML approach, we provide an example focused on injury prediction in soccer.

We take publicly shared data by NFL for sports analytic competition & analyzed for relationship between playing surface, NFL player's movements, and their injury, leading to potentially improving the performance and minimizing the risk of injury. The article also briefly underlines the importance of critical sports parameters accurate data collection & direct impact on ML accuracy in prediction too.
