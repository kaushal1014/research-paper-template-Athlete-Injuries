# Introduction

As [Perdita Stevens](https://www.stevens-bradfield.com/~perdita/) points out in
[*How to Write Good
Programs*](https://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/computer-science/computing-general-interest/how-write-good-programs-guide-students),
"ethical programming includes being honest about the extent to which you can be
confident that your program is good, and adhering to quality control processes
that ensure if a mistake has been made &mdash; everybody makes mistakes &mdash;
it is found and rectified before it causes harm." She also writes that an
ethical programmer should be "a decent human being"!

What should you do to ensure that you write source code and documentation in an
ethical fashion? How can you become a programmer who is an empathetic member of
a software engineering team? If you complete the projects on this site and adopt
the principles that it introduces you will have embarked on an adventure to
become a **proactive programmer** who "acts in anticipation of future problems,
needs, or changes".[^1]

Hello my name is Greg!

I wish that I could eat dinner tonight with everyone in our class!

*Okay, let's become proactive programmers so that we can put the PRO in
programmer!*

[^1]: See Merriam-Webster for the definition of
  "[proactive](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/proactive)" and
  examples of sentences using the word. What do you think are the
  characteristics of a proactive programmer?
