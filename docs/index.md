# Machine learning meets sports: Predicting the injuries of NFL players due to variation in playing surface

Hello, my name is Kaushal,

I am a student at Delhi Public School Bangalore East studying in the 12th grade who is passionate about computer science and swimming.
This is the moment I have lived many times in my sports career. Being a competitive swimmer for years, I have experienced what inevitable injuries mean to a sports person. Injuries are part of the sports that we all experience, but what one does not know is the agony and the pain that a sports person goes through of not being able to practice every day or missing those competitions, or even losing those nail-biting finishes as pains stop letting you give your 100%.
Now that in the covid times, my competitive swimming career had temporarily been suspended, and I have also devoted my time to my second passion developing skillsets in machine learning and AI.

A 2-year consecutive state medalist in swimming at the 2018 and 2019 junior championships in Karnataka. In my swimming journey, I have endured injuries that have not only hindered my performance but also have kept me out of practice. To help the athlete community, I have decided to combine my two passions, computer science and love of sport, to help better understand the usage of Machine learning in sports.
