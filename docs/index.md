# Machine learning meets sports: Predicting the injuries of NFL players due to variation in playing surface

Hello, my name is Kaushal,
I am a student at Delhi Public School Bangalore East studying in the 12th grade who is passionate about computer science and swimming.
 
A 2-year consecutive state medalist in swimming at the 2018 and 2019 junior championships in Karnataka and completed prestigious courses in the computer science field. In my swimming journey, I have endured injuries that have not only hindered my performance but also have kept me out of practice. To help the athlete community, I have decided to combine my 2 passions, computer science and love of sport, to help better understand the usage of Machine learning in sports.
