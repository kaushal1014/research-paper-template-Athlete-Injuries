# Abstract

Data about sports have long been the subject of research and analysis by sports scientists. The increasing size and availability of these data have also attracted the attention of researchers in machine learning, computer vision, and artificial intelligence. However, these communities ***seldomly interact***. Machine learning has been applied to many areas of science, health care, and finance industries, such as image detection, cancer detection, stock market prediction, and customer churn prediction. In some areas, such as sports, the effective use of machine learning has still enormous scope for improvement. Can it be used to accuratley predict injuries? How much can we rely on it? Can players use it to enhance their performances?


The paper takes deep dive into the positive impact of ML integration on sports analytics and answerins these questions. It is evident that ML can unearth great potential insights with a data-driven approach & decision making. This paper focuses on deploying the ML into the field of predicting sports injury. Machine Learning not only increases the knowledge of sports injury but also assists in proactively taking steps to avoid sports injury by predicting ahead of time.__The big challenges for these approaches consist of data acquisition, data transformation and augmentation__, which often require in-depth knowledge of the sport in question, as well as understanding which ML techniques are well-suited not only for final modeling but also for data preparation.


This Paper utilizes the advances in automatic and interactive data analysis with the help of machine learning & establishes the intricacies of the playing surface & injury relationship. Public data shared by NFL for sports analytic competition is analyzed for the relationship between playing surface, NFL players' movements, and their injury, leading to potentially improving the performance and minimizing the risk of injury. The article also briefly underlines the importance of critical sports parameters accurate data collection & direct impact on ML accuracy in prediction too.
