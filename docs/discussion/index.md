***Recommendations from the study:***

It is clearly evident from the ML analysis, that Synthetic surface leads to (a) a Higher injury rate (b) a Higher Severity of injury based on the number of days absent (c) Tends to more injury at the beginning of the turf. (d) lower limb or foot-related injuries on the synthetic surfaces 
 
Since ML can handle large amounts of Data, one of the possible recommendations to NFL is to further improve & increase parameters sensitivity. NFL can also add variables like footwear, padding and even putting accelerometer/wearable device to measure the physical parameters of athletes. The application of ML opens up the door to infinite opportunities for sports science.    
 
In the second continued phase study, we can now collect more data around lower-limb injuries, so this is seen more on artificial turf. This can further improve assessment and accordingly, then we can work on the prevention of injuries by means of various proactive measurements. This opens up further study of injury prevention and sports training modules in conjunction with ML technique & applications.
